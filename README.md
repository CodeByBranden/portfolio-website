This is my portfolio website where I host all past and current projects.

## Running this website locally

Clone the repo and  run `npm install`. After the dependency installs are complete, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
